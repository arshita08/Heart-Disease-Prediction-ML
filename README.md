# Heart Disease Prediction With Machine Learning ü´Ä

Welcome to the **Heart Disease Prediction With Machine Learning** project! This repository demonstrates a comprehensive approach to predicting heart disease using machine learning. It leverages four powerful algorithms to achieve impressive accuracy and provides valuable insights into early heart disease detection.



## Project Overview

This project is based on the IEEE paper titled:  
**Effective Feature Engineering Technique for Heart Disease Prediction With Machine Learning**  
and is also referred to as **Heart Disease Prediction With Machine Learning**.

### IEEE Base Paper Abstract
Heart failure is a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide. This study introduces a novel Principal Component Heart Failure (PCHF) feature engineering technique to select the most significant features from patient data. Extensive experiments with nine machine learning algorithms (with a decision tree method achieving 100% accuracy) were performed to enhance early detection and support effective treatment strategies.

### Project Abstract
The project harnesses the power of Python and machine learning to predict heart disease with remarkable accuracy. By employing four algorithms‚ÄîRandom Forest Classifier, Bagging Classifier, XG Boost, and LightGBM‚Äîthe system achieved 100% accuracy on both training and test datasets using a dataset comprising 1025 records with 14 features. This work sets a high standard for predictive healthcare analytics and offers a robust tool for early diagnosis.
