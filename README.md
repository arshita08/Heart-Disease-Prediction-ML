## Project Overview

This project is inspired by the IEEE paper titled:  
**Effective Feature Engineering Technique for Heart Disease Prediction With Machine Learning**  

### IEEE Base Paper Abstract
Heart failure is a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide. The referenced study introduces a novel Principal Component Heart Failure (PCHF) feature engineering technique to select the most significant features from patient data. Through extensive experiments, the decision tree method achieved 100% accuracy, showcasing the power of machine learning in early detection and effective treatment strategies.

### Project Abstract
Our implementation uses Python-based machine learning to predict heart disease with remarkable accuracy. By employing four distinct algorithms (Random Forest Classifier, Bagging Classifier, XG Boost, and LightGBM), the system achieved 100% accuracy on both training and test datasets, working with a dataset of 1025 records across 14 features. This project underscores the potential of predictive analytics in healthcare, enabling more reliable diagnosis and timely intervention.
