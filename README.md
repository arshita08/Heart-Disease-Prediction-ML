# Heart Disease Prediction With Machine Learning ü´Ä

Welcome to the **Heart Disease Prediction With Machine Learning** project! This repository demonstrates a comprehensive approach to predicting heart disease using machine learning. By leveraging four powerful algorithms‚ÄîRandom Forest, Bagging Classifier, XG Boost, and LightGBM‚Äîthe project achieves outstanding accuracy and provides insights into early detection.


## Project Overview

This project is inspired by the IEEE paper titled:  
**Effective Feature Engineering Technique for Heart Disease Prediction With Machine Learning**

### IEEE Base Paper Abstract
Heart failure is a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide. The referenced study introduces a novel Principal Component Heart Failure (PCHF) feature engineering technique to select the most significant features from patient data. Through extensive experiments, the decision tree method achieved 100% accuracy, showcasing the power of machine learning in early detection and effective treatment strategies.

### Project Abstract
Our implementation uses Python-based machine learning to predict heart disease with remarkable accuracy. By employing four distinct algorithms (Random Forest Classifier, Bagging Classifier, XG Boost, and LightGBM), the system achieved 100% accuracy on both training and test datasets, working with a dataset of 1025 records across 14 features. This project underscores the potential of predictive analytics in healthcare, enabling more reliable diagnosis and timely intervention.
